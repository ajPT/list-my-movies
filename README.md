# list-my-movies

This is one of the apps made in Udemy's iOS course "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional". I want to do a little more than the requirements so I added web requests (OMDB API and themoviedb API) and json parsing.
This app covers the following fields:
* UITableView
* UIImagePicker
* Core Data
* Webkit (WKWebView)
* Web Requests & json parsing
